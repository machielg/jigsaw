Java 9 Platform Module System (Jigsaw) sample maven project

This example project shows a basic usage of dependency design between modules based on SOLID principles, specifcally Dependency Inversion and Interface Segregation

To build run 
```mvn clean package``` from the root. 

I haven't figured out if Maven has support for module based running using the module path.
